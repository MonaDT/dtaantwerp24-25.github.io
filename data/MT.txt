If you're blue, and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits? Puttin' on the ritz
Different types of wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat
Perfect fits, puttin' on the ritz
Dressed up like a million-dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (super-duper)
Come, let's mix where Rockefellers walk with sticks or umbrellas in their mitts
Puttin' on the ritz
Have you seen the well-to-do, up and down Park Avenue?
On that famous thoroughfare with their noses in the air?
High hats and arrow collars, white spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime for a wonderful time
If you're blue, and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits? Puttin' on the ritz
Different types of wear a day coat, pants with stripes and cutaway coat
Perfect fits, puttin' on the ritz
Dressed up like a million-dollar trooper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper (super-duper)

If you're blue, and you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits? Puttin' on the ritz, puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz, puttin' on the ritz
Downtown, uptown, get your kicks at the Ritz
Dine and wine, but not 'til nine, the time is right for us tonight
We gotta move, move to the rhythm
