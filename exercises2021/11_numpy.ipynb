An example in sentiment analysis is that you have some product reviews and you want to classify them into Positive or Negative sentiment. If you can visualize your data, this might be how it looks in 2D, where classes are identified with color; e.g. the blue points are positive reviews and the orange points are the negative ones: \n",
