Teaching Roles
--------------

Each class in the schedule has a first and second tutor. The first tutor
is responsible for the **class notebook** and the second tutor is
responsible for the **exercise notebook**.

All assignments have been made via GitHub issues.

Notebooks
---------

All notebooks should be self-contained documents that students can
follow without verbal support.

### Class notebook

-   Markdown Cells

    -   Link all staff, datasets, and supporting material in the first cell.

    -   Use prose to guide the student.

    -   Use images and diagrams to explain structures where useful.

-   Data & Figures

    -   Use http:// for all images and datasets. This will maintain functionality irrespective of student saving habits.

    -   For data and images that are **not** online already, push them to the Github
        [[data/]{.ul}](https://github.com/dtaantwerp/dtaantwerp.github.io/tree/master/data)
        directory, and use the http:// link within the notebook. i.e.
        through !wget or a hyperlink in markdown.

-   Code

    -   Use singular examples of each step of a process. The exercise notebook will contain repetitive exercises for the students to
        practice with.

    -   If you plan to code a cell live, include the complete result within the notebook.

### Exercise notebook

Each exercise notebook should correspond to a teaching class, and repeat
examples with minimal description.

-   Markdown

    -   Reference the class notebook and staff in the first cell.

    -   Avoid prose and link to the class notebook instead of explaining concepts.

-   Data

    -   Share data via http:///.

-   Code

    -   Give repetitive examples of problems from the class notebook, some easier and some harder.

    -   Break down examples from the class notebook into sub steps.

Material from 2020
------------------

We have copied material from 2020's bootcamp into the new notebooks in
[notebooks2021/](https://github.com/dtaantwerp/dtaantwerp.github.io/tree/master/notebooks2021).
It does not completely align with the new course structure and most
notebooks will require replanning.

If you wish to use 2020 material other than that which is in the 2021
notebook already, go to
[notebooks/](https://github.com/dtaantwerp/dtaantwerp.github.io/tree/master/notebooks).

Sharing material with students
------------------------------

Homepage: The Github repo will have a markdown homepage with a schedule
and links to each notebook. Students will be able to download a zip of
all material and data, or individual notebooks for a class. Pushing to
github will update this material.

Blackboard: A copy of the above homepage will be on blackboard with the
same links.

Assignments
-----------

All assignments are filed as GitHub Issues.
