    "- the `break` keyword is nested inside an `if` statement that is itself part of a `while` loop. In such cases, the `while` loop is called the **outer** control structure and the `if` the **inner** control structure. In spite of this **nesting**, Python knows that it has to look for the \"nearest loop\" and kill that, which happens indeed when `idx` reaches the value of 10. Here, \"nearest\" technically means: the \"smallest enclosing loop\".\n",
    "- this particular `while` is intentionally set up to run forever (in principle), using the line `while True:`. This is a construction you will often see: `True` in this case is a boolean **constant** (not a variable!) that cannot be changed once the program has started. This will effectively result in a statement that is always `True`, meaning that your loop will continue until something unexpected would happen (i.e. encountering the `break` keyword). This is commonly used because you can set up a simple iterator in this way, that will incessantly perform a certain action -- it's an indefinite loop that you set up *on purpose*."
