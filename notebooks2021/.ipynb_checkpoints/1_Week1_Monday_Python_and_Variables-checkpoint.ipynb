    "## Programming Languages\n",
    "    \n",
    "A programming language is similar to a natural language, it has form and meaning, it even has a concept of idioms (programming clichés) and paraphrases (there are many ways to implement the same piece of code). \n",

    "Fluency in programming requires \n",
    "- being able to translate ideas into algorithms\n",
    "- formulating the algorithms as efficient code\n",
    "- understanding and adapting code by others \n",
    "- using an appropriate programming style \n",
    "\n",
    "However, ambiguity and incompleteness are *not* allowed! Computers take everything literally.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithms \n",
    "\n",
    "An algorithm (informally) is a finite series of steps computing an output from a (possibly empty) input in a reasonable time. It is similar to the mathematical concept of a function, which also maps inputs to outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of algorithms are finding all palindromes in a text (input is a text, output is a list of palindromes), making a frequency dictionary on the basis of a corpus (input is a list of texts, output is a dictionary of all the words in the corpus with their frequency in the corpus), etc.\n",

    "Soon you will be able to actually do this yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Programming  \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of programming entails:\n",
    "1. Finding an algorithm for solving a problem (the semantics of the program) \n",
    "2. Implement it in correct, efficient code (the syntax of the program)\n",
    "3. This process often entails decomposition: split up a complex problem into less complex subproblems until they are simple enough to be easily implemented\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is Open Source (free) and available for all computer platforms\n",
    "- It is well-suited for processing text\n",
    "- MANY useful \"libraries\" for Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Scientific programming, Statistics, ...\n",
    "- Good first programming language for people new to programming\n",
    "- Helpful Python community, many tutorials online, e.g., Stackoverflow\n",
    "\n",
    "## Translation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is a high-level programming language that has to be translated to a language that the computer understands (machine language)\n",
    "    - Compiler\n",
    "        - Translates a complete “source” program directly to machine code ready for execution by the CPU of the computer\n",
    "    - Interpreter\n",
    "        - Translates incrementally, interactively, one piece at a time\n",
