    "## `if` and `else` in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "All programming languages use control structures and Python has its own way of doing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand control structures, we need to understand three key concepts; **keywords**, **whitespace** (or identation), and **logical expressions**. These are a really big deal in Python, so take your time to practice them and try to figure them out properly. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "Keywords are a limited set of reserved terms that Python uses for specific actions. You encountered a few in your last class, like `is`. This is a handy [list of all Python keywords](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will use three keywords: `if`, `else`, and their weird cousin `elif`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "A logical expression is a statement that evaluates to `True` or `False`. In short, it is a test or a check. An example in prose could be \"is the traffic light green?\", \"is it raining?\", \"is this number larger then 5\"?.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Whitespace\n",
    "\n",
    "Whitespace is pretty simple. It's the stuff that separate words. That could be tabs, newline symbols or spaces. In Python, a tab signifies an entry into a **block of code**. This kind of whitespace is also called indentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = True\n",
    "\n",
    "if x:\n",
    "    print('hello')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example above, the tab before `print` separates that statement from the rest of the code. That is what we mean by \"whitespace\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The end of the indented block tells the interpreter that the `if` statement has ended. The interpreter will then handle all further code irrespective of the `if` statement.\n",
    "\n",

    "     width:50%\">\n",
    "<h2> The beauty of Python </h2>\n",
    "Python gives whitespace semantic meaning.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Most other programming languages don't treat whitespace in such a way.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Instead, they use a separate keyword like `endif` or punctuation like `}` to end the if statement. The proponents of those languages (you can call them haters if you want), say that Python is crazy. Python fans say that its crazy beautiful.\n",
