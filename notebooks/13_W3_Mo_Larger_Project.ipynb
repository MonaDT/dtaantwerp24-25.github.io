Before peaking at the task description below: try to describe for yourself, potentially making use of a schematic drawing, what such a system should be able to do.

A **valid password** must be be at least 8 characters long, contain uppercase *and* lowercase characters, as well as two digits, but no punctuation. Store this information in a suitable data structure, but only *if* the user name entered is a **valid email address**.
