    "In Python, each variable is of a certain **type**. In the previous sessions, we've worked with a number of basic or primitive data types already, but without making that very explicit. For now, we'll focus on the following primitive data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **int**: for \"integers\" (or whole numbers)\n",
    "- **float**: for \"floating-point\" numbers\n",
    "- **str**: for textual \"strings\" of characters\n",
    "- **bool**: for \"boolean\" or binary variables that can only take on two values\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more data types in Python (and you can in fact define your own data types for variables if you want to, which we'll cover in the sessions on object orientation). Nevertheless, just knowing about these four essential data types will get you a very long way already.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session, we'll go over these four data types again and review some of their basic properties. Next, we'll move to the topic of **collections**, which are useful constructs in Python that allow you to manipulate structured assemblages (sets, arrays, lists, etc.) of the more primitive data types."
