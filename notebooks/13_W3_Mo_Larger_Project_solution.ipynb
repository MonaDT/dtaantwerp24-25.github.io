Before peaking at the task description below: try to describe for yourself, potentially making use of a schematic drawing, what such a system should be able to do.

A **valid password** must be be at least 8 characters long, contain uppercase *and* lowercase characters, as well as two digits, but no punctuation. Store this information in a suitable data structure, but only *if* the user name entered is a **valid email address**. For the sake of simplicity, you can limit yourself to the following dummy rules as to what constitutes a valid email address:\n",
    "    + It contains (exactly one) \"@\".\n",
    "    + It ends in \".com\", \".org\", or \".be\".\n",
    "    + It contains no other punctuation than '-', '@' and '.'\n",
    "    \n",
    "- (B) Ask the user (via `input()`) to login with her/his **credentials** and grant access to the website the password matches an existing user in the database. If the user three times enters a false password, send a **warning email** to the email address that was used as user name in the last attempt.\n",
